Installing PyBrain and its dependencies
=======================================

There are several requirements for PyBrain and we will go through them step by
step.


Python
------

On most Unix systems as Linux or Mac OS X, Python is already
installed, but you should check if it is the right version - otherwise you will
get weird errors. One way to do this is on the commandline::

   $ python --version
   Python 2.5.2

.. note::

   Most command line examples will have a Unix look, but all of them are usable
   on Windows systems, too.

If you have not installed Python, you should go to the `official Python download
page <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide/Download>`_ and follow the
instructions there.


Setuptools
----------

Setuptools is a package that contains Python's package manager and makes
installation of python packages easier. We will use this for the requirements.

First, download this `bootstrap script
<http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py>`_
and run it::

   $ python ez_setup.py

.. note::

   On Unix systems, you will possibly have to run these commands as a superuser.


Scipy and Matplotlib
--------------------

This will install the python package manager Easy Install for you. Afterwards,
you can do::

   $ easy_install scipy
   $ easy_install matplotlib

This might take longer, since scipy will also compile different things.

.. note:

   You will possibly run into trouble in this step. If compilation fails at this
   point, check out the official webpages http://scipy.org and
   http://matplotlib.sf.net - also, if you are on a linux system, your package
   manager will most probably have a suitable package for you.


PyBrain
-------

There are three ways of installing PyBrain: you can either go with our stable
release on `the webpage <http://pybrain.org/pages/download>`_ or the bleeding
edge from our git repository.

To check out the PyBrain repository run::

   $ git clone git://github.com/pybrain/pybrain.git pybrain

If you are unfamiliar with git, there is also a direct download to the latest
version `here <http://github.com/pybrain/pybrain/tarball/master>`_.

Change into the directory Pybrain directory after either checking out got or
downloading and extracting the archive. There you run (possibly as a superuser
on Unix systems)::

   $ python setup.py install

Now everything should be installed. To test if it works fine, go into Python and
import PyBrain. You should see something like this::

   $ python
   Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Sep 17 2008, 11:21:23)
   [GCC 4.0.1 (Apple Inc. build 5465)] on darwin
   Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
   >>> import pybrain
   >>>

If this works, you are set.
